        <p>From July 2021 to June 2022, there have been over 2,500 book bannings in either libraries or classrooms, the majority of these novels focusing on the critical representation of minority groups. 
        </p>
        
        <p>"I've heard of librarians that have quit their jobs because they've been stretched as thin as they can," said Syracuse University reference and institution librarian Patricia Giles. </p>
        
        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/by-the-numbers">ALA</a> Office for Intellectual Freedom, there were 1,269 demands to censor library books and resources in 2022, which is the highest number of demands since their first report over twenty years ago. According to Giles, the reasoning for this stems from a higher percentage of novels written by and detailing the struggles of minority groups. </p>

          <p>"When I was a kid, you couldn't find books on those (minority) issues, I think the reason for the increase has to do with the number of books that are being published on certain topics, so, you know, people are objecting to anything that has to do with race, sexuality or culture," said Giles.</p>

        
        <p>By gathering and analyzing data from PEN America's July 2021 to June 2022 <a href="https://pen.org/banned-in-the-usa/#what">banned books dataset</a>, it is evident that current book bannings target minority groups like Black authors and aim to ban novels focusing on queer content. </p>

        <h2> 
          <div class="sub-head-1"> Banned Black Authors </div> </h2>

        <p>Despite white authors being the most frequently banned in the U.S., when compared to how often they are published, it becomes clear that they no longer hold the title of most commonly banned authors.</p>

  <iframe title="The Percentage Gap Between Banned and Published Authors Across Racial Categories " aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-eLV19" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eLV19/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="583" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script> 

        
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.zippia.com/author-jobs/demographics/">Zippa</a>, the most common race of published authors is white, with 75.6 percent of authors attributed to white descent. In comparison, Black authors only make up 5.9 percent of published authors. When compared to the amount that Black authors are banned, amounting to 16.20 percent between 2021 and 2022, it is clear that Black authors are banned twice as much as they are published. </p>
        <p>With statistics like these, it's apparent that authors that produce novels like Toni Morrison's "Beloved", Frederick Douglass' "Narrative of The Life of Frederick Douglass: An American Slave", and Ta-Nehisi Coates' "Between the World and Me", that are critical to teaching students around the U.S. about issues of racism and slavery, are the primary target for book bannings in the U.S. </p>

        <p> With Black authors, a well-known minority group, holding the highest ranking for the most frequently banned race of authors in the U.S., the question, "What other minority group grabs the attention of conservative parents, teachers, and library patrons," arises.  </p>

        <h2> 
          <div class="sub-head-1"> Banned Queer Novels </div> </h2>

        <p> Through heavy research and analysis of the books referenced from the PEN dataset, it is apparent that novels with themes of queer identity, yet another minority group, have been banned at an increased amount. </p>

        <iframe title="The Top Themes in Banned Literature " aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-T6GTg" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/T6GTg/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="488" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>By evaluating each novel within PEN's dataset based on the overarching theme that connects to the grounds each novel was banned on, we found that novels with themes of queer identity and race were banned the most during the dataset's 12-month span. Novels with themes of queer identity account for 34.1 percent of banned novels, while novels with themes surrounding race account for 16.4 percent of banned novels during the dataset's timespan. </p>

      <p> While the censorship of queer and Black voices only heightens by the minute, it is imperative that we understand the ins and outs of the book-banning process. </p>

      <h2> 
          <div class="sub-head-1">The Book Banning Process and How You Can Help! </div> </h2>

      <p> The book-banning process begins with a 'challenge'; an attempt to remove the book. According to Giles, "Book banning usually happens in schools and public libraries, and it's normally a patron who objects to a book, though these things are getting more organized, and I think that's a part of why it's ramping up." </p>

      <p>Challenges can be presented to a hearing, which results in either the book ban or an overturn, which allows the book to remain in distribution. </p>

      <p>Events like Banned Books Week and Read-outs can help bring attention to banned books, which may help the banning eventually get overturned. </p>

      <p> Syracuse University Bird Library fights against the book-banning process by celebrating <a href="https://researchguides.library.syr.edu/BannedBooksWeek/">Banned Books Week</a> with a Read-Out in partnership with the university's English department. </p>

      <p> "I hope our banned book readings will get some people to hear about it and to listen for a while and think, 'Oh, I didn't know that book was banned," said Giles. </p>

      <p> Banned Books Week was celebrated from Oct. 1-7 this year and has been <a href="https://bimcal.com/calendar/banned-books-week">tentatively scheduled</a> for Sept. 22-28, 2024. </p>
